Reference values of different lymphocyte subsets in a coun- try where the HIV infection or other immune disease are widely spread are necessary for monitoring and predicting the immune status. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in- fection, the flow cytometric determination of CD4􏰂 T lympho- cytes has been one of the main immunological markers used to monitor the disease in HIV-infected children and adults.


Two-thirds of all people infected with HIV live in sub-Sa- haran Africa, although this region contains little more than 10% of the world’s population (23). The prevalence of HIV-1 infection in Cameroon is ca. 5.5% in adults (2). In Cameroon, where many HIV-1 subtypes circulate (7, 11, 15, 21), vertical transmission of HIV contributes to a majority of the pediatric AIDS cases.
