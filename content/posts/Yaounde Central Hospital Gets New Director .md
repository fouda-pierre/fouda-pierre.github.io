Dr Pierre Joseph Fouda took over command on Monday October 1 in Yaounde.

Dr Pierre Joseph Fouda has been called to specifically give attention to ameliorating good governance and the management of the Yaounde Central Hospital. The call was made yesterday, October 2 by the Minister of Public Health, André Mama Fouda as he commissioned him as the new director of the Yaounde Central Hospital following his appointment on September 18, 2012 by Prime Ministerial decree. Dr Fouda replaces Professor Lucienne Bella Assumpta who headed the hospital for over three years.

During the commissioning ceremony at the premises of the hospital, the Minister of Public Health told Dr Fouda to draw inspiration from the Rapid Results Initiative on course in the hospital to better manage the hospital. While noting that the Central Hospital has some specificity, notably a strong social and trade union dimension amongst others, André Mama Fouda said the challenge of the new director will be to maintain social dialogue within the different groups in the institution. After lauding the out-going director for her efforts in conserving the Yaounde Central Hospital as the mother hospital in the town, the Minister of Public Health said it is time for Dr Pierre Joseph Fouda to reinforce the performance of the hospital so as to satisfy the needs of patients. He also called on workers in the hospital to support their new director for the good of patients and the good reputation of the hospital.

Until his commissioning as the Director of the Yaounde Central Hospital, Dr Fouda was the Administrator of the “Chantal Biya” International Reference Centre for Research on HIV and AIDS Prevention and Management (CIRCB). Since 2008, he headed HIV research works at CIRCB. As director of the Yaounde Central Hospital, one could say Dr Pierre Joseph is the square peg in a square hold given that since 1997, he has been working as Head of the Andrology Service of the Yaounde Central Hospital.
